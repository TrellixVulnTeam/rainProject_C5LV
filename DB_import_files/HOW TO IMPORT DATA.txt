HOW TO IMPORT DATA INTO YOUR RAIN DATABASE
-------------------------------------------------------


DO NOT IMPORT DATA THROUGH MONGODB COMPASS!!!


RAIN uses MongoDB as a database with Django as a backend.
Mongo does not have auto-incrementing primary keys and as 
such will not keep track of them if you import through Compass.
The auto-increment indexes are maintained by Django so we must 
import through Django using the command line.

The .json files contained in this folder are Django fixtures.
Fixtures are Django-specific, formatted import files and 
contain the data you will be importing into your database.


The following commands must be run from inside the pip virtual 
shell inside the rainProject folder.

TO IMPORT A DATA FILE INTO DATABASE:                                                                        /-------------------------------------------------\
    * FILE_NAME is the name of the .json file inside the DB_import_files folder you want to import.         | YOU MUST DROP THE DATABASE BEFORE IMPORTING ANY |
                                                                                                            | OF THE PROTOCOLS, SEQUENCES, OR KEYWORD DATA    |
    python3 manage.py loaddata ../DB_import_files/FILE_NAME.json                                            \-------------------------------------------------/

TO EXPORT A DATA FILE FROM DATABASE:
    * APP_NAME is the name of one of the folders inside the backend folder.
    * MODEL_NAME is the name of one of the classes inside the app's models.py file.
    * FILE_NAME is what you want the file to be called.

    python3 manage.py dumpdata APP_NAME.MODEL_NAME > FILE_NAME.json

* Exporting will place the new file in the rainProject folder.
  You will have to move it to the DB_import_files folder.
